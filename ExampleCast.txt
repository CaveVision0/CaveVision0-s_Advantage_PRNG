Hi! I haven't sorted out fixes for all the ways you could possibly bust this up yet so try to stick with a similar format to this!

This program doesn't account for the existence of multiple copies of the same advantage. All it does is use RNG then tell you if someone found an advantage that exists.

Example Format:
[[Name]]    STRING
[[Desperation Tier]]    SPECIFIC STRINGS (see advantage_roll.cpp's map for the strings; found in int main())
[[Team Name]]    STRING
[[Real Clues for Advantage 1]]    INT
[[Fake Clues for Advantage 1]]    INT
[[Real Clues for Advantage 2]]    INT
[[Fake Clues for Advantage 2]]    INT (The number of integers below the desperation tier may vary depending on how many advantages you have. Go for (#Advantage_Types * 2).)
[[Whitespace For Separation]]    STRING
