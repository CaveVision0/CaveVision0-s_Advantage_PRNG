The number of integers below the desperation tier may vary depending on how many advantages you have. Go for (#Advantage_Types * 2).

This program doesn't account for the existence of multiple copies of the same advantage. All it does is use RNG then tell you if someone found an advantage that exists.

Example Format:
[[Name]]    STRING
[[Desperation Tier]]    SPECIFIC STRINGS (see advantage_roll.cpp's int main())
[[Team Name]]    STRING
[[Real Clues for Advantage 1]]    UNSIGNED INT (0 to 4294967295)
[[Fake Clues for Advantage 1]]    UNSIGNED INT (0 to 4294967295)
[[Real Clues for Advantage 2]]    UNSIGNED INT (0 to 4294967295)
[[Fake Clues for Advantage 2]]    UNSIGNED INT (0 to 4294967295)
